summary: Defense of my doctoral dissertation titled "Correcting Misperceptions About Contested Topics Through Science Communication"
abstract: "The public does not agree about the facts surrounding a number of formidable challenges that the world is facing. Science communication plays an important role in informing people about the facts related to such important societal topics, but it is not always effective. The aim of my dissertation is to investigate how people stick to false beliefs in the face of corrective information and how science communication can improve to help people come to scientifically accurate beliefs.
